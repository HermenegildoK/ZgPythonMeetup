# Protocol and Abstract Base Classes

## [Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#module-abc)
- what are they?
  - user defined types
  - a way to define interfaces
- when to use them?
  - where you need strong checks

## [Protocol](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/protocol.html)
- what is it?
  - type of structural subtyping (static duck typing)
  - a way to define interfaces
- when to use it?
  - when you need to have more freedom
  - you like static typing more than subclassing

## Which is better?
- depends
